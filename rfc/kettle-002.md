# Block allocation

Block ID | Owner | Usage description
:---: | :--- | :---
E0~FF | Kettle Core Team | Blocks are in use for the core protocol

## Error structure

The error structure is defined on block **E0**, which becomes a valid error structure reference.

```
{
  // [REQ] User friendly error message.
  "message": "I don't know this packet type `15` for block `E5`",
  // [OPT] Implementation related context.
  "context": "Packet identifier: E5-F2-00-15"
}
```

## Block distribution

Block ID | Used for | Notes
:---: | :--- | :---
E0 | Endpoint information exchange | Used for polling supported blocks and operations.
E1 | Meta Game Information | Used for exchanging information about specific games. eg: Player accounts, mode, ranks, decks.
E2 | Game State requests | Used for exchanging information of a specific game. eg: Game history/Tag changes.

The responder WILL KEEP sending kettle response packets with the Complete flag UNSET.

  "from_block_id": u32,

  // The history array holds the same objects as defined by E2-1's `history` key.

# E2-3

> No request structure

## Response

Identical structure of E2-2's response.



# Notes

1. Both card_id and dbf_id are valid keys on entity details. Both keys are optional, but when both provided the dbf_id takes precedence.

2. `PowerType::`, `MetaDataType::`, `GameTag::`, `FormatType::`, `GameType::` are integer types (u32), which range is limited to the
values contained by the enumerations, with corresponding name, defined by hearthstonejson.com
